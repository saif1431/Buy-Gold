            <h3>1.0 RunescapeGP is a venue</h3>
            <p>
              1.1 RunescapeGP acts as a venue to allow users who comply with RunescapeGP's
              policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods. RunescapeGP is not
              directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers.
              As a result, RunescapeGP has no control over the quality, safety,
              morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth
              or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items
              or the ability of buyers to pay for items. RunescapeGP does not
              pre-screen users (except for services that require an application)
              or the content or information provided by users. RunescapeGP cannot
              ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a
              transaction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Consequently, RunescapeGP does not transfer legal ownership of items
              from the seller to the buyer. RunescapeGP cannot guarantee the true
              identity, age, and nationality of a user. RunescapeGP encourages you to
              communicate directly with potential transaction partners through
              the tools available on the site
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You agree that RunescapeGP is a venue and as such is not responsible or
              liable for any content, for example, data, text, information,
              usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video,
              items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on
              RunescapeGP. You use the RunescapeGP service at your own risk.

            <p>
              RunescapeGP's services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely
              suspended RunescapeGP members. RunescapeGP reserves the right, in RunescapeGP's sole
              discretion, to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. RunescapeGP
              reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at
              any time.

            <h3>3.0 Fees</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Joining RunescapeGP is free. RunescapeGP charges fees for items sold via the
              Services. When you list an item, you have an opportunity to review
              and accept the fees that you will be charged.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes
              associated with using RunescapeGP.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If RunescapeGP terminates a listing or your account, if you close your
              account, or if the payment of your RunescapeGP fees cannot be completed
              for any reason, you remain obligated to pay RunescapeGP for all unpaid
              fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is
              not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties
              such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the
              account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining
              collection agencies and legal counsel).

            <h3>4.0 Listing, Selling, and Buying</h3>
            <br />
            <p>4.1 Listing Description</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              All listings on RunescapeGP must be for sale. By listing an item, you
              warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with RunescapeGP's
              policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item.
              Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics,
              pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All
              items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate
              tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the
              item/items for sale in that listing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.2 Binding Sale</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and
              buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before
              making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated
              to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the
              buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional
              circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of
              the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller
              cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated
              to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there
              is an exceptional circumstance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.3 Fee Avoidance</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The price stated in each item listing description must be an
              accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable
              shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and
              mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees
              or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after
              a sale for the purpose of avoiding RunescapeGP transaction fees,
              misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account
              without permission.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.4 Payment Processing</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              RunescapeGP, in its sole discretion, may inspect and verify (i) details
              related to the listing sold, (ii) the buyer of the listing and
              (iii) the seller of the listing. As a part of the verification
              process, RunescapeGP may require the seller or buyer to provide
              additional identification information, including, without
              limitation, a copy of a valid driver's license (or other form of
              government issued identification) prior to or during the
              transaction. Users may also be asked to go through additional
              security procedures and share additional information to confirm
              their identity. RunescapeGP reserves the right to reject any item(s)
              that we believe (in our sole discretion) may: (i) be fraudulent,
              invalid, inauthentic or stolen, (ii) have come from an
              unauthorized or illegal source, (iii) be related to any illegal
              activity or (iv) otherwise pose a financial risk to us or our
              users.

              this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms as in
              the Payment Services Agreements. As a condition of selling, you
              agree to provide RunescapeGP accurate and complete information about you
              and your business, and you authorize RunescapeGP to share, in accordance
              with the Payment Services Agreement, such information and
              applicable transaction information related to your use of the
              payment processing services provided by the Payment Processors.
