              <p>RuneScape gold is the virtual currency that is used in both Old School Runescape and RuneScape 3. Players in both games can acquire RuneScape gold through various activities, such as skilling, PvM, PvP, merchanting, questing, and minigames. No matter what activity you’re doing in the game, gold is central to every activity.

							RuneScape is known for being a game about grinding to get to the fun content. A lot of the grinding in the game comes down to getting the gold you need to continue. Whether you’re a new player who wants to get a head start or you’re looking to max out your PvM gear, buying RuneScape gold is a great way to spend less time grinding, and more time doing what you love in the game.</p>
