            <h3>1.0 PieGP is a venue</h3>
            <p>
              1.1 PieGP acts as a venue to allow users who comply with PieGP's
              policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods. PieGP is not
              directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers.
              As a result, PieGP has no control over the quality, safety,
              morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth
              or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items
              or the ability of buyers to pay for items. PieGP does not
              pre-screen users (except for services that require an application)
              or the content or information provided by users. PieGP cannot
              ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a
              transaction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Consequently, PieGP does not transfer legal ownership of items
              from the seller to the buyer. PieGP cannot guarantee the true
              identity, age, and nationality of a user. PieGP encourages you to
              communicate directly with potential transaction partners through
              the tools available on the site
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You agree that PieGP is a venue and as such is not responsible or
              liable for any content, for example, data, text, information,
              usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video,
              items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on
              PieGP. You use the PieGP service at your own risk.

              PieGP's services are not available to temporarily or indefinitely
              suspended PieGP members. PieGP reserves the right, in PieGP's sole
              discretion, to cancel unconfirmed or inactive accounts. PieGP
              reserves the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason, at

            <h3>3.0 Fees</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Joining PieGP is free. PieGP charges fees for items sold via the
              Services. When you list an item, you have an opportunity to review
              and accept the fees that you will be charged.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes
              associated with using PieGP.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              If PieGP terminates a listing or your account, if you close your
              account, or if the payment of your PieGP fees cannot be completed
              for any reason, you remain obligated to pay PieGP for all unpaid
              fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is
              not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties
              such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the
              account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining
              collection agencies and legal counsel).

            <h3>4.0 Listing, Selling, and Buying</h3>
            <br />
            <p>4.1 Listing Description</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              All listings on PieGP must be for sale. By listing an item, you
              warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with PieGP's
              policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item.
              Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics,
              pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All
              items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate
              tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the
              item/items for sale in that listing.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.2 Binding Sale</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and
              buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before
              making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated
              to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the
              buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional
              circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of
              the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller
              cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated
              to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there
              is an exceptional circumstance.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.3 Fee Avoidance</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The price stated in each item listing description must be an
              accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable
              shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and
              mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees
              or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after
              a sale for the purpose of avoiding PieGP transaction fees,
              misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account
              without permission.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>4.4 Payment Processing</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              PieGP, in its sole discretion, may inspect and verify (i) details
              related to the listing sold, (ii) the buyer of the listing and
              (iii) the seller of the listing. As a part of the verification
              process, PieGP may require the seller or buyer to provide
              additional identification information, including, without
              limitation, a copy of a valid driver's license (or other form of
              government issued identification) prior to or during the
              transaction. Users may also be asked to go through additional
              security procedures and share additional information to confirm
              their identity. PieGP reserves the right to reject any item(s)
              that we believe (in our sole discretion) may: (i) be fraudulent,
              invalid, inauthentic or stolen, (ii) have come from an
              unauthorized or illegal source, (iii) be related to any illegal
              activity or (iv) otherwise pose a financial risk to us or our
              users.

              this Agreement shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms as in
              the Payment Services Agreements. As a condition of selling, you
              agree to provide PieGP accurate and complete information about you
              and your business, and you authorize PieGP to share, in accordance
              with the Payment Services Agreement, such information and
              applicable transaction information related to your use of the
              payment processing services provided by the Payment Processors.
